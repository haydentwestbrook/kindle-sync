## How to Push When Network is Available

### Option 1: Direct Push (when network works)
```bash
cd /home/hayden/workspace/kindle-sync
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Check Network and Retry
```bash
# Test connectivity
ping github.com

# If connectivity works, push
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Alternative Push Methods
```bash
# Try with HTTPS instead of SSH
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/haydentwestbrook/kindle-sync.git
git push origin main

# Or try with different SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # or your preferred key
git push origin main
```

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Check commits ready to push
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD

# Check remote configuration
git remote -v
```

## What's Been Accomplished

### ✅ Testing & Deployment
- Comprehensive testing plan created and executed
- Core functionality tested locally and on Raspberry Pi
- Successful deployment to Pi at 192.168.0.12
- All core components working: config, PDF conversion, file watching, Kindle sync

### ✅ Production Readiness
- Python 3.9.2 environment set up on Pi
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Core functionality tested and working
- Ready for production configuration and service startup

### ✅ Documentation
- Complete testing documentation
- Deployment success summary
- Next steps for production configuration
- Troubleshooting guides

## Next Steps After Push

1. **Configure Production Settings on Pi:**
   ```bash
   ssh hayden@192.168.0.12
   cd /home/hayden/kindle-sync
   nano config.yaml
   ```

2. **Set Up Obsidian Vault:**
   - Update vault path in config.yaml
   - Create sync folder structure

3. **Start the Service:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/hayden/kindle-sync
   source venv/bin/activate
   python3 main_enhanced.py
   ```

## Summary

All changes are committed locally and ready to push. The deployment to Raspberry Pi was successful, and the system is production-ready. Once network connectivity is restored, simply run `git push origin main` to publish all changes to the remote repository.
