# Local Testing Plan - Working Around Network Issues

## Current Situation
- ‚úÖ Core functionality tested and working
- ‚ùå Network connectivity issues preventing package installation
- ‚ùå Cannot test database operations, async processing, email functionality
- ‚ùå Cannot test Docker build

## What We Can Test Locally

### ‚úÖ Already Tested and Working
1. **Configuration Management**
   - Config loading from YAML
   - Secrets management
   - Path resolution
   - Validation

2. **PDF Conversion**
   - Markdown to PDF conversion
   - File handling
   - Error handling

3. **File Watching**
   - File system monitoring
   - Event handling
   - Callback mechanisms

4. **Health Monitoring**
   - Health check execution
   - Status reporting
   - Multiple check types

5. **Basic Kindle Sync**
   - Initialization
   - Configuration reading
   - SMTP settings

### üîÑ Can Test with Mocking
1. **Database Operations**
   - Mock SQLAlchemy operations
   - Test database models
   - Test database manager logic

2. **Async Processing**
   - Mock async operations
   - Test processing logic
   - Test error handling

3. **Email Functionality**
   - Mock SMTP operations
   - Test email sending logic
   - Test email receiving logic

### üìã Manual Testing Checklist
1. **File Processing Workflow**
   - Create test markdown files
   - Test PDF conversion
   - Verify file handling

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Test different config scenarios
   - Test error handling
   - Test path validation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test with invalid files
   - Test with missing paths
   - Test with invalid configurations

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Complete Local Testing (Current)
- ‚úÖ Test all available core functionality
- ‚úÖ Create comprehensive test report
- ‚úÖ Document what works and what needs network access

### Phase 2: Mock Testing
- Create mock tests for database operations
- Create mock tests for async processing
- Create mock tests for email functionality

### Phase 3: Manual Integration Testing
- Test complete workflow manually
- Verify file processing end-to-end
- Test error scenarios

### Phase 4: Production Testing
- Deploy to Raspberry Pi
- Test with real network connectivity
- Complete integration testing on target platform

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Local Testing** ‚úÖ (Done)
2. **Create Mock Tests** (Next)
3. **Manual Integration Testing** (Next)
4. **Deploy to Pi for Full Testing** (Final)

## Production Deployment Strategy

Since we have network issues in the development environment, we should:

1. **Deploy to Raspberry Pi** where network connectivity should work
2. **Test on target platform** with real dependencies
3. **Use Docker** to ensure consistent environment
4. **Monitor deployment** with health checks

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Tested Locally)
- Configuration management
- PDF conversion
- File watching
- Health monitoring

### Medium Risk (Needs Testing)
- Database operations
- Async processing
- Email functionality

### High Risk (Cannot Test Locally)
- Docker deployment
- Network-dependent operations
- Full integration workflow

## Recommendation

**Proceed with deployment to Raspberry Pi** where we can:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Test complete functionality
3. Verify Docker deployment
4. Complete integration testing

The core functionality is solid and tested. The remaining issues are primarily network-related and should resolve on the target platform.
